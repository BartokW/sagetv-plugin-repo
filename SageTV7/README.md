# SageTV7 Temporary Plugins File

Copy this `SageTVPluginsDev.xml` file to your root of your SageTV installation directory.  This will enable you to install the "broken" plugins hosted on google code.

`NOTE:` This increments all plugin versions with a .7 so that SageTV will see them as being modified.

`NOTE:` Once you installed your plugins, you should remove this file.
